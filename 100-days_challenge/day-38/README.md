I learnt about recursion today.

-Recursion is a technique that leads to elegant solutions to problems that are difficult to program using simple loops. To use recursion is to program using recursive methods—that is, to use methods that invoke themselves. Recursion is a useful programming technique. In some cases, it enables you to develop a natural, straightforward, simple solution to an otherwise difficult problem.

-Many mathematical functions are defined using recursion such as finding the factorial of a number n and finding the Fibonacci series.

-For a recursive method to terminate, the problem must eventually be reduced to a stopping case, at which point the method returns a result to its caller. The caller then performs a computation and returns the result to its own caller. This process continues until the result is passed back to the original caller.

-If you think recursively, you can solve many problems using recursion. All recursive methods have the following characteristics:

 ■The method is implemented using an if-else or a switch statement that leads to different cases.
 ■ One or more base cases (the simplest case) are used to stop recursion.
 ■ Every recursive call reduces the original problem, bringing it increasingly closer to a base case until it becomes that case.
