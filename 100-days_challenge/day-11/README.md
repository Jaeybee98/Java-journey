#day11 of #100days

Okay, so i was unable to learn anything yesterday which was supposed to be #day11 due to some unavaoidable factor and the ongoing general elections in my home country.

So, today i learnt about OOP concepts: Classes and Objects.

-A class is a template for objects. It defines the properties of objects and provides constructors for creating objects and methods for manipulating them. A class is also a data type. You can use it to declare object reference variables. An object reference variable that appears to hold an object actually contains a reference to that object. Strictly speaking, an object reference variable and an object are different, but most of the time the distinction can be ignored.

-An object is an instance of a class. You use the new operator to create an object and the dot operator (.) to access members of that object through its reference variable. An instance variable or method belongs to an instance of a class. Its use is associated with individual instances. A static variable is a variable shared by all instances of the same class. A static method is a method that can be invoked without using instances.

-Every instance of a class can access the classâ€™s static variables and methods.For clarity, however, it is better to invoke static variables and methods using ClassName .variable and ClassName.method.

-Visibility modifiers specify how the class, method, and data are accessed. A public class, method, or data is accessible to all clients. A private method or data is accessible only inside the class.

-You can provide a getter (accessor) method or a setter (mutator) method to enable clients to see or modify the data.

So, i wrote a program that defines a class called TV with some basic TV functions.
