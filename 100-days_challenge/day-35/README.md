I learnt about Object I/O and it's classes today.

-ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream classes can be used to read/write serializable objects. DataInputStream/DataOutputStream enables you to perform I/O for primitive-type values and strings. ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream enables you to performÂ I/O for objects in addition to primitive-type values and strings. Since ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream contains all the functions of DataInputStream/DataOutputStream, you can replace DataInputStream/DataOutputStream completely with ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream.

I tried to learn about Serializing arrays today but ALX's tasks today was daunting and time-consuming. I will continue from where i stopped tomorrow, hopefully.
