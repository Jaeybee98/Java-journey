Today, i learnt modularising codes in java by the use of methods otherwise called functions in other languages. 

METHODS: A method definition consists of it's method-name, parameters, return-value-type and body. syntax is: 
modifier returnVaueType methodName (parameters) {
		body;
	}

-The method header specifies the modifiers, return value type, method name, and parameters of the method.

-The returnValueType is the data type of the value the method returns. If the method does not return a value, the returnValueType is the keyword void.

-The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of a method’s parameters. The method name and the parameter list together constitute the method signature. Parameters are optional; that is, a method doesn’t need to contain any parameters.

-The arguments that are passed to a method should have the same number, type, and order as the parameters in the method signature.

-When a program calls a method, program control is transferred to the called method. A called method returns control to the caller when its return statement is executed, or when its method-ending closing brace is reached.

Methods or modularisation is a broad and useful construct in java, so to understand it deeply, i've divided the study into two parts and the second part will be completed tomorrow #day7. i practised some basic implementation of modularisation by writing a method defined to find the larger between two integers and a program that displays the greatest common divisor of two integers entered by the user.
