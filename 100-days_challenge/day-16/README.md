Today, i made a deep-dive into OOP proper. I learnt about Class Abstraction and Encapsulation, Class Relationships

-Class abstraction is separation of class implementation from the use of a class. The details of implementation are encapsulated and hidden from the user. This is known as class encapsulation. Java provides many levels of abstraction, and class abstraction separates class implementation from how the class is used. The creator of a class describes the functions of the class and lets the user know how the class can be used. The collection of public constructors, methods, and fields that are accessible from outside the class, together with the description of how these members are expected to behave, serves as the classâ€™s contract. 

-To design classes, you need to explore the relationships among classes. The common relationships among classes are association, aggregation, composition, and inheritance. 

I wrote a program, a Loan class. The interest rate, loan amount, and loan period are its data properties and computing the monthly and total payments are its methods. You can then use the methods to find the monthly payment and total payment of your loan.
