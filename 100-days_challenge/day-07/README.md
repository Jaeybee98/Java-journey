So, today i continued the study of methods and program modularisation in java. I learnt about method overloading. A method can be overloaded. This means that two methods can have the same name, as long as their method parameter lists differ i.e a method e.g max() can be overloaded in a way that it can work with all types of numeric data-types.

-Method abstraction is achieved by separating the use of a method from its implementation. The client can use a method without knowing how it is implemented. The details of the implementation are encapsulated in the method and hidden from the client who invokes the method. This is known as information hiding or encapsulation.
Method abstraction modularizes programs in a neat, hierarchical manner. Programs written as collections of concise methods are easier to write, debug, maintain, and modify than would otherwise be the case. This writing style also promotes method reusability.

I learnt also the scope of variables and the importance of knowing it. The scope of a local variable starts from its declaration and continues to the end of the block that contains the variable. A variable declared in a method is called a local variable. A local variable must be declared and initialized before it is used. 

So, i wrote a program practising method overloading by creating three methods that finds the maximum integer, double and the third finds the maximum double among three double values.
