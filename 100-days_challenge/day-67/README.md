Yesterday, i introduced myselt to Multithreading and Parallel Programming. So, today, i learnt how to Create Tasks and Threads.

-A task class must implement the Runnable interface. A task must be run from a thread. Tasks are objects. To create tasks, you have to first define a class for tasks, which implements the Runnable interface. The Runnable interface is rather simple. All it contains is the runÂ method. You need to implement this method to tell the system how your thread is going to run.
