Today, i also continued Classes and Objects. I learnt about visibility modifiers, data field encapsulation, getter and setter methods

-Visibility Modifiers: Visibility modifiers can be used to specify the visibility of a class and its members. You can use the public visibility modifier for classes, methods, and data fields to denote they can be accessed from any other classes. If no visibility modifier is used, then by default the classes, methods, and data fields are accessible by any class in the same package. This is known as package-private or package-access. Package-private (or package-access).

Packages can be used to organize classes. To do so, you need to add the following line as the first noncomment and nonblank statement in the program using packages (package packageName;) If a class is defined without the package statement, it is said to be placed in the default package. Java recommends that you place classes into packages rather than using a default package.

-Data Field Encapsulation: Making data fields private protects data and makes the class easy to maintain. To prevent direct modifications of data fields, you should declare the data fields private, using the private modifier. This is known as data field encapsulation. To make a private data field accessible, provide a getter method to return its value. To enable a private data field to be updated, provide a setter method to set a new value. A getter method is also referred to as an accessor and a setter to a mutator. 

I was trying to write a an updated version of the circle class i wrote yesterday but i couldn't finish it. I'll continue tomorrow.
