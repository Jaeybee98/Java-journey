I continued the OOP concepts i was learning yesterday. I learnt about the differences between Method Overriding and Method Overloading, The Object class and it's toString method, Polymorphism

-Overloading means to define multiple methods with the same name but different signatures. Overriding means to provide a new implementation for a method in the subclass. To override a method, the method must be defined in the subclass using the same signature and the same or compatible return type.

-Overridden methods are in different classes related by inheritance; overloaded methods can be either in the same class, or in different classes related by inheritance.

-Overridden methods have the same signature; overloaded methods have the same name but different parameter lists.

-Every class in Java is descended from the java.lang.Object class. If no inheritance is specified when a class is defined, the superclass of the class is Object by default. Classes such as String, StringBuilder etc are implicitly subclasses of Object.

-Polymorphism means that a variable of a supertype can refer to a subtype object. The three pillars of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

I wrote some programs to practise and test what i've learnt today.
