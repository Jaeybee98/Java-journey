#day3 of #100daysofcode 

I solidified my knowledge of the conditionals i learnt yesterday and some more programs putting everything i've learnt into practise. 
Also, i learnt more about common java Math functions such as:

1- Trigonometric functions which includes methods that returns the trigonometric sine of an angle in radius, a method that returns the trigonometric cosine of an angle in radius etc.

2- Exponent functions which includes methods that return a value raised to power, a method that return the base 10 logarithm of x, a method that returns the square root of x.

3-Service functions which includes the rounding, min, max, random and absolute methods.

Java also provides two useful double constants in the Math class, PI and E(the base of natural logarithms).

I also learnt about conditional expressions with no explicit "if" statements with the syntax: boolean-expression ? expression1 : expression2;

So, to further solidify my understanding of the conditionals(if-statements, boolean expressions and switch statements) i wrote a basic lottery game program and a program that prints the grade for a given score.
