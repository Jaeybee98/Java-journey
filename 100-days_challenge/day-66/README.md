#day66 of #100days 

Lately, i've been so engrossed in trying to finish ALX's simple shell project and i couldn't really learn anything new, although, i made sure i practised some of the things i've learnt.

So, today, i did a brief introduction to Multithreading and Parallel Programming and  the concepts of threads and how multithreading programs can be developed in Java.

-One of the powerful features of Java is its built-in support for multithreadingâ€”the concurrent running of multiple tasks within a program. In many programming languages, you have to invoke system-dependent procedures and functions to implement multithreading.

-A program may consist of many tasks that can run concurrently. A thread is the flow of execution, from beginning to end, of a task. A thread provides the mechanism for running a task. With Java, you can launch multiple threads from a program concurrently. These threads can be executed simultaneously in multiprocessor systems.

-In single-processor systems, the multiple threads share CPU time, known as time sharing, and the operating system is responsible for scheduling and allocating resources to them. This arrangement is practical because most of the time the CPU is idle. It does nothing, for example, while waiting for the user to enter data. 

-Multithreading can make your program more responsive and interactive, as well as enhance performance. For example, a good word processor lets you print or save a file while you are typing. In some cases, multithreaded programs run faster than single-threaded programs even on single-processor systems. Java provides exceptionally good support for creating and running threads and for locking resources to prevent conflicts.

-You can create additional threads to run concurrent tasks in the program. In Java, each task is an instance of the Runnable interface, also called a runnable object. A thread is essentially an object that facilitates the execution of a task.

Tomorrow, i'll get into it proper and write some programs.
