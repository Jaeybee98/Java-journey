Okay, so today is the #day02 of my #100 days challenge.

I learnt about selection statements, boolean expressions and operators, switch statements, break keyword, how operators in expressions are evaluated, and role of parenthesis in order of evaluation and i will be explaining some of those concepts.

0-SELECTION STATEMENTS: Like all high-level programming languages, Java provides selection statements. Statements that let you choose actions with alternative courses. Examples of selection statements are boolean expressions, if-else statements, switch statements.

1-BOOLEAN EXPRESSION: Selection statements use conditions that are Boolean expressions. A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (true or false) using the boolean type and relational operators.

2-IF-STATEMENTS: An if statement is a construct that enables a program to specify alternative paths of execution. Java has several types of if-statements: one-way if statements, two-way if-else statements, nested if statements, multi-way if-else statements.

3-SWITCH STATEMENTS: A switch statement executes statements based on the value of a variable or an expression. Java provides a switch statement to simplify coding for multiple conditions.

4-DEFAULT AND BREAK KEYWORDS:The default case, which is optional, can be used to perform actions when none of the specified cases matches the switch-expression. The keyword break is optional. The break statement immediately ends the switch statement.

I wrote some programs to practise what i've learnt today, i wrote a program that calculates BMI(body mass index), a program that generates random numbers for a subtraction quiz and a program that uses boolean expressions to check whether a year is a leap year or not.
