#day13 of #100days

So today, i learnt more about Classes and Objects. I learnt about  static variables,instance variables, constants and methods.

-A static variable is shared by all objects of the class. A static method cannot access instance members (i.e., instance data fields and methods) of the class. If you want all the instances of a class to share data, use static variables, also known as class variables. Static variables store values for the variables in a common memory location. Because of this common location, if one object changes the value of a static variable, all objects of the same class are affected. Java supports static methods as well as static variables. Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.

-An instance variable is tied to a specific instance of the class; it is not shared among objects of the same class.

I couldn't really learn much today, ALX SE's tasks/projects was daunting today.

So i wrote a Circle class today showing how to use instance and static variables and methods.
