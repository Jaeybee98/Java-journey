Today, i continued the Heap Sort i was learning yesterday.

To sort an array using a heap, first create an object using the Heap class, add all the elements to the heap using the add method, and remove all the elements from the heap using the remove method. The elements are removed in descending order.

Youtube, Geekforgeeks and  Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures by Daniel Liang were very helpful.
