Today, i learnt more about OOP (Polymorphism and Inheritance), Overriding Methods

-Object-oriented programming allows you to define new classes from existing classes. This is called inheritance. Inheritance is an important and powerful feature for reusing software. Inheritance is an important and powerful feature for reusing software. Inheritance enables you to define a general class (i.e., a superclass) and later extend it to more specialized classes (i.e., subclasses).

-A constructor is used to construct an instance of a class. Unlike properties and methods, the constructors of a superclass are not inherited in the subclass. They can be invoked only from the constructors of the subclasses, using the keyword super.

-A constructor may invoke an overloaded constructor or its superclass’s constructor. The call must be the first statement in the constructor. If none of them is invoked explicitly, the compiler puts super() as the first statement in the constructor, which invokes the superclass’s no-arg constructor.

-To override a method, the method must be defined in the subclass using the same signature as in its superclass. A subclass inherits methods from a superclass. Sometimes, it is necessary for the subclass to modify the implementation of a method defined in the superclass. This is referred to as method overriding.

i wrote some simple programs practising what i learnt today.
