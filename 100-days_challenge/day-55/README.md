-Today, i learnt about Heap Sort.

-A heap sort uses a binary heap. It first adds all the elements to a heap and then removes the largest elements successively to obtain a sorted list. Heap sorts use a binary heap, which is a complete binary tree. A binary tree is a hierarchical structure. It either is empty or it consists of an element, called the root, and two distinct binary trees, called the left subtree and right subtree. The length of a path is the number of the edges in the path. The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to the node.

-A binary heap is a binary tree with the following properties:
	■ Shape property: It is a complete binary tree.
	■ Heap property: Each node is greater than or equal to any of its children.
A binary tree is complete if each of its levels is full, except that the last level may not be full and all the leaves on the last level are placed leftmost. 

I couldn't finish it today. Heap sort is kind of complex, i'm yet to learn how to add a new node, etc.
