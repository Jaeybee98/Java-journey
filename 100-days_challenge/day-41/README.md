Today, after successfully finishing ALX's C-printf project, i decided not to learn anything new and just practise some of the things i've learnt.

I created a simpe banking app with some basic functionalities of a bank account like a deposit of amount, withdrawal of amount, etc.

Initially, the program accepts the number of customers we need to add and adds the customer and account details accordingly. Further, it displays the series of menus to operate over the accounts.

The series of menus displayed are as follows:
   -Display all account details
   -Search by account number
   -Deposit the amount
   -Withdraw the amount
   -Exit

For this program, javatpoint and youtube was very helpful.
