I learnt about Java Collections today.

-The Collection interface defines the common operations for lists, vectors, stacks, queues, priority queues, and sets.

-The Java Collections Framework supports two types of containers:
 ■ One for storing a collection of elements is simply called a collection.
 ■ The other, for storing key/value pairs, is called a map.
Maps are efficient data structures for quickly searching an element using a key.
 ■ Sets store a group of nonduplicate elements.
 ■ Lists store an ordered collection of elements.
 ■ Stacks store objects that are processed in a last-in, first-out fashion.
 ■ Queues store objects that are processed in a first-in, first-out fashion.
 ■ PriorityQueues store objects that are processed in the order of their priorities.
