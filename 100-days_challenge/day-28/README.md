#day28 of #100days

I continued from where i stopped yesterday. I learnt about reading data from Scanner, how Scanner works

-I've been using the Scanner class to read inputs from the console. today, i learnt about using it to read from a fie. To read from a file, create a Scanner for a file, as follows: Scanner input = new Scanner(new File(filename));

I couldn't learn much today due to the difficulty of ALX's tasks today (C- malloc). Hopefully, i'd be able to learn more tomorrow.
