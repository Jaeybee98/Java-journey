I learnt about Thread Synchronization today.

-Thread synchronization is to coordinate the execution of the dependent threads. A shared resource may become corrupted if it is accessed simultaneously by multiple threads.

For reasons i'm yet to know, Thread Synchronization has been somewhat confusing for me. I just can fully grasp it yet, hopefully, i'll be able to get it tomorrow.
