I learnt about Sorting algorithms.

-Sorting algorithms are good examples for studying algorithm design and analysis.
   ■ First, sorting algorithms illustrate many creative approaches to problem solving, and these approaches can be applied to solve other problems.
   ■ Second, sorting algorithms are good for practicing fundamental programming techniques using selection statements, loops, methods, and arrays.
   ■ Third, sorting algorithms are excellent examples to demonstrate algorithm performance.

There are many algorithms for sorting. There is Selection sort, Insertion sort, Bubble sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Bucket sort, Radix sort, and External sort.

I learnt only Insertion Sort today.
