#day10 of #100days

Today, i couldn't really learn much due to the fact that there's a general election here in my home country Nigeria and i participated in the election by performing my civic responsibility. 

Notwithstanding, i still made sure i learnt something. So, today, i learnt about multi-dimensional arrays.

-Multi-dimensional(two-dimensional arrays and three-dimensional arrays) arrays: They can be used to store a matrix or a table. An element in a two-dimensional array is accessed through a row and a column index. The syntax for declaring a two-dimensional array is as follows:elementType[][] arrayRefVar; or elementType arrayRefVar[][];.

In java, array initializer can also be used to declare, create, and initialise a two-dimensional array. 

A two-dimensional array is actually an array in which each element is a one-dimensional array. Each row in a two-dimensional array is itself an array. Thus, the rows can have different lengths.

Two-dimensional arrays ca also be passed to a method just as you can pass one-dimensional array.

A multidimensional array is actually an array in which each element is another array. A three-dimensional array is an array of two-dimensional arrays. A two-dimensional array is an array of one-dimensional arrays. A three-dimensional array can be declared as follows: elementType[][][] arrayVar;

So, i wrote a program that calculates the average daiy temperature and humidity for 10-days.
