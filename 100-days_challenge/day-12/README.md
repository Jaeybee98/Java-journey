I couldn't finish Classes and Objects yesterday, so i continued today. I learnt about constructors, Accessing objects via reference variables. 

-Constructors: A constructor is invoked to create an object using the new operator.

Constructors are a special kind of method. They have three peculiarities:
constructor’s name, no return type.
A constructor must have the same name as the class itself.
Constructors do not have a return type—not even void. 
Constructors are invoked using the new operator when an object is created. Constructors play the role of initializing objects.

-Constructors are used to construct objects. To construct an object from a class, invoke a constructor of the class using the new operator, as follows: new ClassName(arguments);

-A class may be defined without constructors. In this case, a public no-arg constructor with an empty body is implicitly defined in the class. This constructor, called a default constructor, is provided automatically only if no constructors are explicitly defined in the class.

-Accessing Objects via Reference Variables: An object’s data and methods can be accessed through the dot (.) operator via the object’s reference variable. Objects are accessed via the object’s reference variables, which contain references to the objects. Such variables are declared using the following syntax: ClassName objectRefVar;

-A class is essentially a programmer-defined type. A class is a reference type, which means that a variable of the class type can reference an instance of the class.

The Java API contains a rich set of classes for developing Java programs such as The Date Class, The Random class.

So, i practised by using one of the inbuilt java classes called Point2D which can be used to represent a point with x- and y- coordinates.
