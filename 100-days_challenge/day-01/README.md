I'm excited to announce I'll be starting a #100daysofcodechallenge today and I'll be doing so while studying as a software engineering student at alx_africa .

It's important to note that I have some basic knowledge of Java and I'll be consolidating on that knowledge and also learning and unlearning a lot of stuffs in my journey to become a good software engineer.

So, I started #day1 by learning about: 
0- IDENTIFIERS: they're names for naming elements such as variables, constants, methods, classes, packages in a program.
An identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($). It must start with a letter or an underscore. It cannot start with a digit. It cannot be a reserved word. An identifier can be of any length.
1- DATA TYPES: Java provides four integer types (byte, short, int, and long) that represent integers of four different sizes. It also provides two floating-point types (float and double) that represent floating-point numbers of two different precision.
2- OPERATORS: Java provides operators that perform numeric operations: + (addition), – (subtraction),  * (multiplication), / (division), and % (remainder). Integer arithmetic (/) yields an integer result.
The numeric operators in a Java expression are applied the same way as in an arithmetic expression.
3- AUGMENTED ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: Java provides the augmented assignment operators += (addition assignment), –= (subtraction assignment), , *= (multiplication assignment), /= (divisionassignment), and %=
(remainder assignment).
4- INCREMENT OPERATORS AND TYPE CASTINGS.

I wrote some programs putting everything I've learnt into practice, programs such as a program that displays "Hello world" to the console(what's a 100days of code without the Hello world program.), a program that converts a Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula celsius = (5/9 )(fahrenheit - 32), a program that computes the area of a circle with the formula area = radius x radius x π.
