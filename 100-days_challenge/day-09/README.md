I continued learning single-dimensional arrays,i learnt about passing arrays as arguments to a method, Just as you can pass primitive type values to methods, you can also pass arrays to methods.When passing an array to a method, the reference of the array is passed to the method. You can invoke it by passing an array. For example, the following statement invokes the printArray method to display 3, 1, 2, 6, 4, and 2. E.g
printArray(new int[]{3, 1, 2, 6, 4, 2}); 

A method may also return an array, when a method returns an array, the reference of the array is returned. You can pass arrays when invoking a method.

I also learnt about how to sort arrays using various types of sorting techniques inform of searching and also the Arrays class. The java.util.Arrays class contains useful methods for common array operations such as sorting and searching. The java.util.Arrays class contains various static methods for sorting and searching arrays, comparing arrays, filling array elements, and returning a string representation of the array. These methods are overloaded for all primitive types. There are various useful methods in the Arrays class.

i wrote a calculator programme using arrays.
