I continued learning the sorting algorithms i started yesterday. Today, I learnt about Bubble Sort.

-A bubble sort sorts the array in multiple phases. Each pass successively swaps the neighboring elements if the elements are not in order.

-The bubble sort algorithm makes several passes through the array. On each pass, successive neighboring pairs are compared. If a pair is in decreasing order, its values are swapped; otherwise, the values remain unchanged. The technique is called a bubble sort or sinking sort,because the smaller values gradually “bubble” their way to the top and the larger values sink to the bottom. After the first pass, the last element becomes the largest in the array. After the second pass, the second-to-last element becomes the second largest in the array. This process is continued until all elements are sorted.
